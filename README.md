# AstroInvaders
## BASIC 10 Liner for 2021

Flying in your Asteroids space figher returning to Earth after some rock breaking in the asteroid belt, you have intercepted the Space Invaders in training maneuvers on their way to attack the Moon. You must destory the invading fleet to save the moon.

Use the joystick to fly around the fleet (Asteroids style, complete with "flip" mode). Avoid collisions and maneuver for that perfect shot. The fire button engages the single-shot (Space Invader style) photon cannon to eliminate the alien invaders. Score the most points you can before using up your three lives.

## Atari TurboBASIC XL Asteroids and Space Invaders Mashup

AstroInvaders (or Surround or Invaderoids) is a mash up of Asteroids and Space Invaders originally written in 2016. It was tweaked in 2020 during the pandemic to make it a bit more challenging to play. Finally, it was released in 2021 for the [2021 BASIC 10 Liners](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/rules2021) 2021 BASIC 10 Liners game competition in the Extreme 256 category. AstroInvaders was optimized using the [TBXL Parser](https://github.com/dmsc/tbxl-parser).
